## About
The purpose of this web application is to ask users true/false type of questions . The main components of this application include 1)a HTML container that holds questions and answers of the application, along with 2) the use of javascript to generate all the functionality of the application like click events and time set!, which allow the user to answer the question in timely matter and view the answers via the nice user interface of the website.

## Challenges
This is my second javascript application so understanding the idea of creating events was challenge for me but after long hours of study and reading some documentations helped me overcome that challenge. i know that the application still needs some clean up work i will come back and fix it later in the future.
